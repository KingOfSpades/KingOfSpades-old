First off, you can read how and why I created this page in [this blog](/posts/creating-a-ex280-page/).

This page contains an overview of posts relating to [EX280 (Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex280-red-hat-certified-specialist-in-openshift-administration-exam?section=Overview). I studied using the following resource and recommend them in the following order:

1. Sanders great EX280 video course at [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/red-hat-openshift/9780137441938/)
2. I got some in depth knowledge from the book ["OpenShift in action"]()
3. CloudGuru has a great [practice exam available](https://acloudguru.com/hands-on-labs/ex280-practice-exam ). I also tried there study material but found it to be outdated, inaccurate and very shallow.

I also would like to give a shout out to the book ["Kubernetes: Up and Running"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781492046523/). I read this book before I started my OpenShift journey. It's a great way to get familiar with different Kubernetes concepts and packs a lot of knowledge in less then 300 pages.

My hope is that you get something from this because I found EX280 to be quite challenging.
