This page contains an overview of posts relating to [EX280 (Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex280-red-hat-certified-specialist-in-openshift-administration-exam?section=Overview). I studied using the following resource and recomend them in the following order:

1. Sanders great video course at O'Reilly https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/red-hat-openshift/9780137441938/
2. I got some in depth knowledge from the book "OpenShift in action" https://www.manning.com/books/openshift-in-action
3. CloudGuru has a great practice exam availible at https://acloudguru.com/hands-on-labs/ex280-practice-exam . I also tried there study material but found it to be outdated, inacurate and verry shallow.

I also would like to give a shout out to the book "Kubernetes: Up and Running" https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781492046523/ . I read this book before I started my OpenShift journy. It's a great way to get familair with different Kubernets concpets and packs a lot of knowledge in less then 300 pages.

My hope is that you get something from this because I found EX280 to be quite challanging.
